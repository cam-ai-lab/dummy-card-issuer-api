## 📐 API Governance with Spectral

This project uses Spectral to enforce API design standards and naming conventions:

### Enforced Rules

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Property names: `camelCase`
   - Schema names: `PascalCase`
   - Operation IDs: `camelCase`
   - Path parameters: `camelCase`

2. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - All operations must have summaries and descriptions
   - All schemas must have descriptions
   - All properties should have descriptions
   - Operations must have appropriate tags

3. **Response Standards**:
   - All operations must have 2xx responses
   - Operations should have 4xx responses for error cases
   - Error responses must use consistent schema

4. **Metadata Requirements**:
   - API must have contact information
   - API should have license information

### Example Spectral Violations

❌ **Invalid (will fail CI)**:
```yaml
# Property names not in camelCase
properties:
  total_balance: # Should be: totalBalance
    type: number
  membership_reward_points: # Should be: membershipRewardPoints
    type: integer
```

✅ **Valid**:
```yaml
# Correct camelCase naming
properties:
  totalBalance:
    type: number
    description: Current total balance on the account
  membershipRewardPoints:
    type: integer
    description: Available membership reward points
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:

### Quality Gates Workflow
- **TypeScript Type Checking**: Ensures type safety
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting validation
- **Spectral Linting**: API specification governance
- **OpenAPI Validation**: Schema validation
- **Contract Testing**: API endpoint testing
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency and secret scanning

### Branch Protection
- Required status checks (all CI jobs must pass)
- Required pull request reviews
- No direct pushes to main branch
- No force pushes or deletions

## 🛡 Setting Up GitHub Branch Protection

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Initialize git repository
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dummy-card-issuer-api.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Set up Branch Protection** (choose one method):

   **Method A: Using the provided script**
   ```bash
   # Set your GitHub token
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
   
   # Update the script with your GitHub username and repo name
   nano scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
   
   # Run the setup script
   chmod +x scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
   ```

   **Method B: Manual setup via GitHub UI**
   1. Go to your repository on GitHub
   2. Navigate to Settings → Branches
   3. Click "Add rule" for the main branch
   4. Configure:
      - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
      - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
      - ✅ Select status checks: "Code Quality & API Validation", "API Contract Validation", "Security Scan"
      - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
      - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
      - ✅ Require review from code owners (if you have a CODEOWNERS file)
      - ✅ Include administrators
      - ✅ Restrict pushes that create files (prevent force pushes)

## 🔑 Required GitHub Secrets

For the CI/CD pipeline to work properly, set up these repository secrets:

1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add any required secrets (currently none needed for basic setup)

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/test-api-governance
   ```

2. **Make a Change that Violates Spectral Rules**:
   ```yaml
   # In openapi.yaml, change a property to snake_case
   total_balance:  # This will fail Spectral linting
     type: number
   ```

3. **Push and Create PR**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test: violate naming convention"
   git push origin feature/test-api-governance
   ```

4. **Observe CI Failure**: The PR will be blocked due to Spectral linting failure

5. **Fix the Issue**:
   ```yaml
   # Correct the naming back to camelCase
   totalBalance:
     type: number
   ```

6. **Push Fix**: CI should now pass and allow merging

## 🔧 Customizing Spectral Rules

Edit `.spectral.yml` to customize API governance rules:

```yaml
# Add custom rule
rules:
  my-custom-rule:
    description: Custom validation rule
    message: "Custom error message"
    given: "$.paths[*][*]"
    severity: error
    then:
      function: truthy
```

## 📚 API Documentation

- **OpenAPI Spec**: `/openapi.yaml`
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI available at `/docs` endpoint
